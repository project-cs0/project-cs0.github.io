<h2>What am I reading?</h2>
<p>
    This is a free, online textbook designed to teach computer science from
    the ground up. It starts at the very beginning, meaning it assumes that the
    reader has no prior experience with computer science or with programming.
<p>
    The creators of this book want to make these concepts accessible to
    <i>everyone</i>. Whether or not they realize it, most people in today's
    world interact with things that have been programmed by someone else on
    a daily basis. You probably do, too. Maybe you use a computer to access
    the internet. Maybe you send text messages from a smartphone. Maybe you
    wear a digital watch or a hearing aid. All of these things, and many more,
    were designed and programmed by people just like you. And all of those
    programmers started in the same place we assume you are now: with no
    knowledge of computer science. Nobody is born knowing these things. They are
    always learned. This book hopes to help you start that learning.

<h2>Why am I reading it?</h2>
<p>
    Good question... There are lots of reasons you might be reading this book.
    Perhaps it's required reading for a school class. Maybe you're using it
    to study for an exam. Or maybe you just stumbled across it on the internet
    and are hoping it might help you teach yourself how to program. All of these
    are completely valid reasons, and there are countless others that are
    equally valid. Whatever your reason, we hope that you will find this book
    helpful in your journey.

<h2>How should I read this book?</h2>
<p>
    This is another question that is difficult for us, the creators of this
    book, to answer. There could be a million different people reading this
    book for a million different reasons, and each could have their own learning
    style. Some might read every word, in order, from beginning to end. Others
    might skim the section headings and read the ones that sound the most
    interesting. Some might only do the labs, or just glance at the glossary
    occasionally for reference. We want this book to be flexible and to work
    for as many people as possible. It should not matter if you're reading this
    on a computer at your local library, printed on paper and lit by candlelight,
    or on a smartphone while using the bathroom. Just as there is no single
    type of programmer, there is no single way to learn to program.
