        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>What am I reading?</h2>
        <p> This is a free, online textbook designed to teach computer science from the ground up. It starts at the very beginning, meaning it assumes that the reader has no prior experience with computer science or with programming. </p>
        <p> The creators of this book want to make these concepts accessible to <i>everyone</i>. Whether or not they realize it, most people in today's world interact with things that have been programmed by someone else on a daily basis. You probably do,
            too. Maybe you use a computer to access the internet. Maybe you send text messages from a smartphone. Maybe you wear a digital watch. All of these things, and many more, were designed and programmed by people just like you. And all of those
            programmers started in the same place we assume you are now: with no knowledge of computer science. Nobody is born knowing these things. They are always learned. This book hopes to help you start that learning. </p>
        <h2>Why am I reading it?</h2>
        <p> Good question... There are lots of reasons you might be reading this book. Perhaps it's required reading for a school class. Maybe you're using it to study for an exam. Or maybe you just stumbled across it on the internet and are hoping it might
            help you teach yourself how to program. All of these are completely valid reasons, and there are countless others that are equally valid. Whatever your reason, we hope that you will find this book helpful in your <a class="glossary-link" href="/en/glossary.html#journey"

        <p> Here is an example of some code: <code class="language-javascript">test</code>. And some more: <code class="language-javascript">47</code>. </p>
        <figure class="code-example">
            <figcaption>JavaScript</figcaption>
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">const nunjucks = require('nunjucks')
const fs = require('fs')
const path = require('path')
const mkdirp = require('mkdirp')

function doIt(reid, mitchell) {
    return x + 47;
}

const currentDirectory = require('process').cwd() || ''

const getMetadata = (lang) => {
    return require(`./book-files/${lang}/metadata.json`)
}

// Some comment
const omeletOptions = {}

const metadata = getMetadata('en')

const toRender = metadata.chapters.concat([metadata.tableOfContents])
const longLine = "this is a very long line!! it will hopefully cause a horizontal scrollbar to appear";

for (let item of toRender) {
    const rendered = nunjucks.render(item.inFile, {
        "metadata": metadata,
        "rootPath": currentDirectory,
    })

    mkdirp.sync(path.dirname(item.outFile))
    fs.writeFileSync(item.outFile, rendered, 'UTF-8')
}</code></pre> </figure>
        <h2>How should I read this book?</h2>
        <p> This is another question that is difficult for us, the creators of this book, to answer. There could be a million different people reading this book for a million different reasons, and each could have their own learning style. Some might read
            every word, in order, from beginning to end. Others might skim the section headings and read the ones that sound the most interesting. Some might only do the labs, or just glance at the glossary occasionally for reference. We want this book
            to be flexible and to work for as many people as possible. It should not matter if you're reading this on a computer at your local library, printed on paper and lit by candlelight, or on a smartphone while lying in bed. Just as there is no
            single type of computer scientist, there is no single way to learn computer science. </p>
